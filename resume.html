   <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      I'm an enthusiastic person in learning new things and an optimistic person.
      Currently pursuing BTech(2nd year) in Computer Science Engineering at Gayatri Vidya parishad college of Engneering for Women Kommadi,visakhapatnam.
      I actively participate in everything that interests me like Technical and Non technical Events.
      I have recently participated in SQL workshop as well as in the contest which has been conducted as part of Ekathra 2023 in GVPCE(A).
      My inspiration is Miss.Srushti Jayant Deshmukh(IAS) who is able to handle her personal and professional life extraordinarily,
      she has became a young IAS officer to hold that position at the age of 23 that is right after her graduation with so much confidence,perseverance,determination.
      I believe in hard work as well as smart work sometimes(depends on situation) and hardwork never fails.It may not give you immediate results but it never let's you down.
      so try until your last drop....just keep in mind that nothing is impossible and you are possible..
